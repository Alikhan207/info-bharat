# Info-Bharat

A national AI trust layer that sits between citizens and public systems, providing safe, contextual, and explainable guidance at life-critical moments.(AWS AI for Bharat submission)

Info-Bharat is a context-aware AI-powered public decision guidance platform designed for Indian citizens, especially first time, vulnerable, and underserved users.

In India, access to government schemes, education pathways, and social support is often fragmented, confusing, and dependent on intermediaries. This leads to failed applications, misinformation, and exclusion particularly for minors, students, farmers, informal workers, and low literacy users.

Info-Bharat acts as a **trained digital counselor**, not a generic chatbot. It provides safe, eligibility-aware, and step by step guidance by understanding the user's context (age, role, region, life situation) and applying strict safety and legality guardrails.

## Core Principles
- **Context-aware guidance** instead of one size fits all answers
- **Hybrid AI architecture** combining LLM intelligence with rule-based safety controls
- **Protection of vulnerable users** through age-aware and risk-aware guardrails
- **Multilingual and voice-first access** for low-bandwidth and low-literacy environments
- **Application success optimization** to reduce rejections and missed benefits

## Repository Contents
- `requirements.md` — Formal system requirements describing user needs, safety constraints, eligibility validation, and compliance considerations
- `design.md` — Detailed system design including architecture, components, data models, correctness properties, and testing strategy

This repository contains the design-level artifacts generated using Kiro, as requested for the AWS AI for Bharat submission.
